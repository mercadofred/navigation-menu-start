    <h1>Homepage</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my exciting homepage</p>

    <!-- put what your website is all about just below here -->

    <p>This website is all about putting together how to build a website in an easy way, and provide links to some resources such as <a href="https://github.com/mercadofred/mercadofred.github.io"> GitHub</a> which provides free website hosting services</p> 

    <p>The <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/"> Markdown Cheat Sheet, </a>part of the Markdown Guide is a free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document. Markdown can be used instead of HTML to create websites.</p>

    <p>To be clear, we won't be using Markdown as such to create web content, but instead will use the Markdown Cheat Sheet as a reference to the HTML commands one can use to build webpages.</p>

    <p>Lets start by showing you the <a href="index_html.txt"> HTML file used to create this webpage</a>  you are looking at right now.</p>

    <p>First thing to note is the  <a href="basic-html-format.txt"> HTML basic format</a> used to create any webpage. If you are using "Visual Studio Code" as your text editor, you can generate the HTML skeleton file by simply entering "!" in the editor, assuming you have added the "emmet" extension to the "Visual Studio Code" editor.</p>
